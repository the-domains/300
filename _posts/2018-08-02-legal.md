**LETTER
OF RECOMMENDATION**

FOR VASSILIY
KOLGANOV

To The Attention Of: Amnesty International 

I
am currently working with Attorney Vassiliy Kolganov in assisting the Bulgarian
Human Rights and business as independent development consultants and advisors.
I have found him to be extremely thorough in his research and analysis of the
specific business investment projects we have been involved in and it has been
my pleasure to work together with him. He combines his extensive knowledge and
expertise in the Bulgarian legislation, business climate and specific for this
country investment prospective, positive attitude and personal approach to each
individual to communicate complex ideas and concepts in a manner that a lay
person will understand. I can attest to that fact because I have been a witness
of the energy and enthusiasm he has been putting in different projects for the
past few months and I am delighted of his communication and persuasive skills
and in his comfortable style of work. In summary, I believe Mr. Kolganov would
prove to be a valuable Official Representative of Amnesty International. Should
you have any questions or wish to discuss anything I have said in this letter
in private, please do not hesitate to contact me.
