Apostille Service

---

An Apostille is necessary when a document is to be used in a foreign country. An Apostille is used to authentic the origin of where the document is coming from, and our team of notary's can help with this throughout the entire Las Vegas valley.Notarizing an Apostille document is typically the same as notarizing any other document. Although, in some circumstances, depending on the country the document will be used in, it may require a more extensive process with a few more steps.

When getting this type of document notarized it is important to understand the process and what steps to take here in Las Vegas.

1. First, you will need to have the document properly notarized by a mobile notary.
2. Then you will need to get that document authenticated which will then provide you with an Apostille.

Have a notarized document authenticated with an Apostille will allow the other country to see that the process has been completed and the document is authentic, along with the notary.

Apostille documents are automatically sent to the other country once the paper has been notarized, so after the individual notarizes the document, there is no more work on their end.
